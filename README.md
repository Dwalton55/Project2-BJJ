Project 2 Overview For project #2, I've created an app designed to track techniques and progress in jiujitsu.
this is what one would call their jiujitsu game plan.

the site is a test site based on a coach or a school view.  the school personel will be able to see different students/ users and their game plans. the school can then add to that users information/gameplans/and techniques. I have alot of plans for future add ons but have yet to begin implementing these.
